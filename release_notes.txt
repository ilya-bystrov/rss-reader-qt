QML RSS Reader
==============

The RSS Reader example application demonstrates the use of RSS feed resources 
on the Internet. It contains a rich UI with view navigation, search, accordion 
list, and animations. The UI components are designed to be reusable in other 
applications. RSS Reader uses the QML local storage to store the feeds that 
the user has subscribed to. The application also demonstrates how the 
graphical theme can be switched from the settings view.
