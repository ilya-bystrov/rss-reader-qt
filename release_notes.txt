QML RSS Reader v.1.4
====================

This RSS Reader example application demonstrates the use of RSS feed resources.
It presents the content of feed in a rich UI with view navigation, search,
accordion list, and animations. The UI components are designed to be reusable
in other  applications. RSS Reader uses the QML local storage to store the
feeds that the user has subscribed to. The application also demonstrates how
a graphical theme can be switched, from the settings view.
