\title QML RSS Reader example 

The RSS Reader Example Application demonstrates the use of RSS feed resources on 
the net. It contains a rich UI with view navigation, search, accordion list and 
animations. The UI components are designed to be reusable in other applications. 
RSS Reader uses the QML local storage to store the feeds that the user has 
subscribed. The application also demonstrates how the graphical theme can be 
switched from the settings view.
